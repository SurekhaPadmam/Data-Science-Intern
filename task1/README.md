Hi Everyone, I as an intern have done the TASK 1 "Prediction Using Supervised ML".
The procedures is as follows:
Dataset Considered is:https://github.com/SurekhaPadmam/Data-Science-Intern/blob/main/task1/student-scores.csv
    Imported the Database
    Splitted dataset into training set and testing set using sklearn.model_selection
    Visualized the training set and testing set to understand easily
    Initialized the regression model and fitting it using training set (both X and y).
    Finally predicted the yvalue for given x value( for given x -9.25 hrs, predicted the corresponding yvalue)
the code is here:
